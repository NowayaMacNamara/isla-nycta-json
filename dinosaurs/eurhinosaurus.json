        "These predators primarily reside in the open ocean but venture into shallower areas like bays, estuaries, and coral reefs during migration or birthing seasons in warmer periods.",
        "Employing swift and agile maneuvers, the group adeptly encircles and herds prey before launching a coordinated attack, whether it involves slashing through schools of smaller prey or inflicting gouges on larger quarry.",
        "To foster bonding, younger individuals may actively participate in group \"porpoising,\" engaging in acrobatic displays that encompass vertical and high-arcing leaps, as well as spins and twists, showcasing their agility and coordination.",
        "They will sometimes carry an accessory to show off their fitness or enhance their appearance. A fascination with lake sponge, pretty shells, or other items may spread to the whole pod as a fashion craze until the next fad is found, while objects from the land such as flowers or mushrooms are of particular interest to these aquatic creatures due to their novelty."
