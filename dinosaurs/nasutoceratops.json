      "A herd of Nasutoceratops are often lead by a alpha male who remains on the outside of the herd keeping an eye out for potential threats.",
      "During mating season males will bullfight for a group of females, this is when the herd may change leadership.",
      "Due to their horns blocking most of their vision, these ceratopsians can be easily startled, broadcasting and running away even if it is not a threat.",
      "When they are raising their young they are highly aggressive towards any Nasu's not within their herd.",
      "Young Nasutoceratops are highly dependent on their parents' care, rarely straying too far from the group."
