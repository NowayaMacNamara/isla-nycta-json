        "Dracovipers are social creatures, often found in small packs where cooperation during hunting is a key feature. In their social groups, they exhibit a balanced and cooperative approach, working together to bring down larger prey or defend their territory from potential threats.",
        "The Dracoviper's venom, secreted by oral glands, contains potent enzymes and toxins. It immobilizes and partially digests prey, allowing efficient nutrient extraction without transporting large carcasses.",
        "The pack's unity relies on an intricate communication system that includes vocalizations, body language, and visual cues. These mechanisms ensure flawless coordination during hunts and promote a sense of unity within the group."
