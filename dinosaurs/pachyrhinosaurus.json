        "Preferring open grasslands, they establish nests in these areas, creating safe environments for raising their young while maintaining a good line of sight for predators.",
        "Due to their protective and cautious nature, they typically remain within their own species, rarely interacting with other herbivores.",
        "The bond between mother and calf is exceptionally strong, with the young often staying close to their mothers for comfort and security."
